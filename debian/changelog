desmume-trunk (svnr3266-0ronmi1) karmic; urgency=low

  *r3266: fix some warnings, move alignment masks ahead of other logic in the
          main mmu routines (fixes potential crashes when accessing totally
          terrible addresses), crudely emulate OP_BKPT (zeromus)

desmume-trunk (svnr3261-0ronmi1) karmic; urgency=low

  * r3261: Update desmume.pot, sorry translators. (riccardom)
  * r3260: Move _NOSSE_MatrixMultVec4x4 declaration in matrix.h
           instead of inside a function in gfx3d.cpp. The _ suggests
           it was meant to be in someway private but it's already
           used outside matrix.cpp. (riccardom)
  * r3259: Remove unused variable in gbagame addon and sort
           initialization order in firmware class to shut up
           gcc warnings. (riccardom)
  * r3258: Shut up declaration vs initialization order gcc warnings.
           (riccardom)
  * r3257: Correct EXPERIMENTAL_WIFI_COMM ifdef position to avoid
           compiling unused stuff. (riccardom)
  * r3256: Remove unused vars. (riccardom)
  * r3255: Check fgets return code and shut up signed vs unsigned
           integer comparison gcc warning. (riccardom)
  * r3254: Make logo_dataconst and shut up gcc warning about signed
           vs unsigned integer comparison. (riccardom)
  * r3253: Add missing parens. (riccardom)
  * r3252: extern is not needed in this declarations. (riccardom)
  * r3251: Remove duplicated NDS_CreateDummyFirmware declaration,
           already available in firmware.h (riccardom)
  * r3250: Add default case to switch to shut up gcc warnings about
           missing handling of possible enum values. (riccardom)
  * r3249: Remove unused vars. (riccardom)
  * r3248: Make some functions static. (riccardom)
  * r3247: Fix includes for version.cpp (riccardom)
  * r3246: Move class members initialization so that gcc stops bitching
           about their order. (riccardom)
  * r3245: The declaration should be under ifdef too. (riccardom)
  * r3244: Move wx specific code inside proper ifdef and fixup wx
           related menu code indentation. (riccardom)
  * r3243: Remove some commented code and fixup a comment indentation while
           at it. (riccardom)
  * r3242: Remove unused but computed baseaddr variable. (riccardom)
  * r3241: Add a simple auto frameskip to the gtk frontend
           
           Add a simple auto frameskip method based on effective fps
           ratio (fps / 60). If the ratio is too low add more frameskip,
           if the ratio is too high or we are skipping too much do
           the opposite. The proposed patch that led to this one is
           available in bug #2862131.
           While at it shorten the number of frameskip values
           available since they skip too much to be playable. (riccardom)
  * r3240: Shut up signed vs unsigned integer comparison warning by gcc.
           (riccardom)
